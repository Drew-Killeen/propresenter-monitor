# ProPresenter Configuration

ProPresenter Monitor gives you a way to view the status of a presentation from anywhere on a local network.

## Setting up ProPresenter

To start, make sure you have both ProPresenter and the ProPresenter Monitor app downloaded. You will need to connect both to the same network.

### Network configuration

To allow your phone or remote device to view the status of ProPresenter, you will first need to enable network access in ProPresenter. This can be done by going to Preferences > Network. Check the box that says "Enable Network," and type in your desired network name and port. If you are unsure, leave it as the default.

Take note of the IP address and port number. This is what you will need to type on on your app to connect.

## Connecting on the ProPresenter Monitor App

Open the app on your phone, and type in the IP and port that you retrieved in the previous step. It should connect immediately. If it does not, verify that you are on the same network and that the IP and port were typed correctly.
